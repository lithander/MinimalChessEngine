# MinimalChessEngine

This repository tracks the process of writing my first chess engine. It's written in C# includes 3 projects:
1. a command-line based GUI (*MinimalChessBoard*) 
1. an [UCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Chess_Interface) chess engine (*MinimalChessEngine*)
1. a library implementing chess logic and algorithms used by the above two applications (*MinimalChess*)

## Motivation

My focus is on creating a minimal engine with just enough features and optimizations to be a reasonably strong player but implemented with a focus simple, human readable code. 

Hopefully it provides me and other interested layman with an opportunity to learn how a chess engine operates and how exactly it's components like move generation or tree search work together.

## Documentation

My development process is also documented by a series of small videos I upload to [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6vJSkTaZuBtTokp8-gnTsP39GCaRS3du) after each milestone:
