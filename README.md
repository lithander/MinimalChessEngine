# MinimalChessEngine

This repository tracks the journey of writing my first chess engine. It's written in C# and contains 3 projects:
1. a command-line based GUI (*MinimalChessBoard*) 
1. an [UCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Chess_Interface) chess engine (*MinimalChessEngine*)
1. a library implementing chess logic and algorithms used by the other two applications (*MinimalChess*)

## Motivation

My focus is on creating a *minimal* engine with just enough features and optimizations to become a reasonably strong player. I try to keep the codebase small and human readable.

Hopefully it provides me and other interested layman with an opportunity to learn how a chess engine operates and how critical components like move generation or tree search can be implemented correctly.

## Documentation

My development process is also documented by a series of small videos I upload to [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6vJSkTaZuBtTokp8-gnTsP39GCaRS3du) after each achieved milestone:
